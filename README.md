Photos on Instagram Over Time
=============================

This tool allows you to graph the number of photos on Instagram over time.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to graph posts made after 7 February 2012, as no media posted after this date has a sequential media ID.

This tool requires that Python is installed on your computer. This tool also requires that you have the Python Client for the Instagram API (https://github.com/Instagram/python-instagram).

First, run the collect.py script. This creates an output.txt file. To create a graph, remove all posts after 7 February 2012, then output.txt can be imported into Microsoft Excel, or another graphing program.

An example graph has been included in this repository.

Further details can be found at the beginning of the collect.py script.
