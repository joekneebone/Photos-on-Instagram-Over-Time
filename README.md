Photos On Instagram Over Time
=============================

This tool allows you to graph the number of photos on Instagram over time.

This tool requires that Python is installed on your computer. This tool also requires that you have the Python Client for the Instagram API (https://github.com/Instagram/python-instagram).

First, run the collect.py script. This creates an output.txt file. To create a graph, output.txt can be imported into Microsoft Excel, or another graphing program.

An example graph has been included in this repository.

Further details can be found at the beginning of the collect.py script.
